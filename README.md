# EstimatorTemplate
A template to use estimators easily.
This code provides you a general understanding of how estimator works. Here instead of using tf.data I gave the input directly, But if you want to use tf.data you can still use this template

Step1- precprocess the data

Step2- Define your architecture

Step3- Adjust train steps, eval steps, batch size accordingly 

Step4- tensorboard logdir to your summaries folder and check your loss curve and eval accuracy

There is also a code snippet for predicting output of your custom file.
